== What is this?

This plugin provides declarative information about GOOSE and Sampled Value subscriptions within the Communication section of an SCL file (which normally only provides publishing information).
The purpose is to assist in development of network configuration information for IEC 61850 without requiring significant processing.

* It does this by exporting of communications data using a `Private` element and custom namespace.

* Two `Private` elements are used, `Transpower-GSE-Subscribe` and `Transpower-SMV-Subscribe` which have identical attribues to the IEC 61850 standard defined SCL `GSE` and `SMV` elements.

Technically:

* This is a plugin for {uri-openscd-core}[open-scd-core], the core editor engine for {uri-openscd}[OpenSCD].

* This plugin is a web component and follows the {uri-openwc}[open-wc] recommendations.

* This plugin uses the link:LICENSE[Apache License] and is intended for you to use, study, share and improve.

== How it works

. Two `Private` elements are provided, `Transpower-GSE-Subscribe` and `Transpower-SMV-Subscribe` which "mimic" the performance of the IEC 61850 SCL standard (IEC 61850-6) defined `GSE` and `SMV` elements.

. For each subscribing control block for an IED, one of these elements is created, using the `etpc` namespace: `pass:[https://transpower.co.nz/SCL/SCD/Communication/v1]`. 
They are created within the appropriate `ConnectedAP`, if it exists, otherwise a new `ConnectedAP` is created.

. Below, an example is given for a GOOSE message:
+
[source,xml]
----
<Private type="Transpower-GSE-Subscribe" etpc:iedName="XAT_T1_P1" etpc:cbName="GoCB16" etpc:ldInst="Master">
    <etpc:Address>
      <etpc:P type="VLAN-ID" xsi:type="tP_VLAN-ID">000</etpc:P>
      <etpc:P type="VLAN-PRIORITY" xsi:type="tP_VLAN-PRIORITY">4</etpc:P>
      <etpc:P type="MAC-Address" xsi:type="tP_MAC-Address">01-0C-CD-01-00-06</etpc:P>
    </etpc:Address>
</Private>
----

. In general, the element and attributes match those for the `GSE` and `SMV` as defined in the standard, however:

* An additional field is used to include the name of the publishing IED, `etpc:iedName`.

* The `SubNetwork` must match between publishers and subscribers for these elements to be written. 
This plugin does not create new `SubNetwork` elements as there should not be a need for this.

* Only `VLAN-ID`, `VLAN-PRIORITY` and `MAC-Address` elements are added (Question: what else should be added? `APPID`?).

== Using the Plugin

Follow the steps in <<Loading the Plugin>>.
Once the plugin is loaded:

. The plugin provides a menu option. 
Go to the menu in the top left and click on the plugin name.

. This will add the information required and remove any prior information this plugin has written (within the `Private` elements).

== Loading the Plugin

=== Online Using the Latest open-scd-core

==== Using a URL

Open SCD core allows plugins to be loaded from a URL.

You can click on {uri-openscd-core-plugin}[this link] to trial this plugin.

In this view it is without theming and only presents this plugin along with the open and save plugins.

==== Manually

. The latest core is available at {uri-openscd-core-app}.

. Go to menu:Menu[Add plugins...]

. Select Cancel - this is an editor plugin.

. Select OK to required a loaded document.

. Choose a plugin name of '{plugin-name}'.

. Choose a plugin icon of 'link'

. Provide a plugin source URI of: {uri-ci-bundle}

. Click OK on the summary, it should indicate the parameters previously entered.

. Open a file and enjoy!

=== Locally for testing

. Clone this project:
+
[subs=+attributes]
....
$ git clone {uri-plugin}
....

. Install dependencies

  $ npm i

. Start up a demo server 

  $ npm run start

. Open in your browser locally at http://localhost:8000/demo/

=== As part of the OpenSCD distribution

TIP: OpenSCD is transitioning to use of `open-scd-core`, these instructions will require updating at the end of this transition.

. Open your OpenSCD distribution or use {uri-openscd-app}.

. Create a custom extension by going to menu:menu[Extensions>Add Custom Extension].

. Enter the name '{plugin-name}', select 'Menu entry' and enter {uri-ci-bundle} as the URL.
+
This is the URL of the bundle built by CI and is always the latest pre-release version of this plugin.
+
.OpenSCD Add Custom Extension Screen
image::screenshot-add-extension.png[width=300]

. Click on menu:Add[].

. This plugin is now available in the menu entry.

=== As part of your own distribution

==== Within the current OpenSCD distribution

. Within the current OpenSCD distribution, plugins are stored in the `public/js/plugins.js` folder. 
Each plugin appears in the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
    name: '{plugin-name}', // <.>
    src: '{uri-ci-bundle}', //  <.>
    icon: 'hub', // <.>
    default: true, // <.>
    kind: 'menu', // <.>
    requireDoc: true, // <.>
    position: 'middle' // <.>
  }
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource. 
For a local resource, begins without a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/oscd-network-data/dist/oscd-network-data.js`. 
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the build process.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> The type of plugin, either `menu` or `editor`. This is an `editor` plugin.
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> A string, either `top`, `middle` or `bottom` to give a location in the menu. 
Otherwise inferred from the order in the file relative to other plugins.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

==== Within an OpenSCD core distribution

Within an OpenSCD core distribution, plugins are also loaded from a json file with a slightly different schema.

. Typically the distribution will be served from a static web page and within the web page there will be a plugins property declared on an `open-scd` object, for instance:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
include::demo/index.html[tag=plugins]
----

. This plugin is an editor plugin, editor plugins are an array of JSON of the following form:
+
[source,js,subs=+attributes]
----
{
  "name": "{plugin-name}", // <.>
  "translations": { // <.>
    "de": "{plugin-name} in German!", 
    "pt":"{plugin-name} in Portuguese!}"
  },
  "icon": "hub", // <.>
  "active": true, // <.>
  "requireDoc": true, // <.>
  "src": "/dist/oscd-network-data.js" // <.>
}
----
<.> Name of the plugin which appears in the editor menu at top of screen
<.> Translations of the plugin name as required using standard locale names.
<.> A material icon, see others at {uri-material-icons}[Material Symbols and Icons]
<.> Whether the plugin is enabled by default or has to be enabled in the plugins menu
<.> Whether a document must be loaded for this plugin to be available
<.> URL which can be a local or remote resource. 
For a local resource, begins with a forward slash, e.g. `plugins/oscd-network-data/dist/oscd-network-data.js`. 
In this case what is shown is loading a plugin from the internet using the continuous integration build process.

. You need to copy an entry like the above, ensure the `src` URL resolves and the plugin should be loaded when the distribution is built.

. If you are building locally you likely need to run an `npm run bundle` command in each plugin to make the `dist` folder, containing a single JavaScript file with the plugin available to OpenSCD.

== Development

=== Linting and formatting

To scan the project for linting and formatting errors, run

[source,bash]
----
npm run lint
----

To automatically fix linting and formatting errors, run

[source,bash]
----
npm run format
----

=== Testing with Web Test Runner

To execute a single test run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run test
----

To run the tests in interactive watch mode run:

[source,bash]
----
npm run test:watch
----

=== Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the number of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

=== Local Demo with `web-dev-server`

To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`

[source,bash]
----
npm start
